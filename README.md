Doctor Appointment Booking App


Creating, testing, and implementing a platform for scheduling medical appointments.


A synopsis of the application
You can quickly schedule appointments with patients using appointment scheduling software. Spend less time back-and-forth emailing to attempt to plan appointments.

Technologies
I have utilized various technologies to create Front-End and Back-End programming languages, frameworks, and tools:

MongoDB - For Document database
Express(.js) - Node.js web framework
React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework
Node(.js) - the premier Javascript web server

I created this entire application from scratch while utilizing sophisticated MongoDB queries, models, and schema. It also has the following characteristics:

-Different user interfaces for admins, doctors, and users.
-Authentication and password hashing using JWT (JSON Web Token).
-Redux Toolkit, Ant Design library for UI Components,
-Functionality for Users, Admins, and Doctors to Receive Notifications.
